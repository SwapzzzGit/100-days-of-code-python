## BMI Calculator

# Problem Statement

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
 
# Example Input

```
weight = 80
```

```
height = 1.75
```

# Example Output

80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) =  26.122448979591837

```
26
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:  

# Problem Output

```
height = input("Enter your height in m : ")
weight = input("Enter your weight in kg : ")

BMI = (int(weight)/float(height) ** 2)
print(int(BMI))

```
