# Instructions

Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string. 


**Tip :** program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

# Example Input

```
Swapnil
```

# Example Output

```
7
```
# Hint

1. You can put functions inside other functions.
2. Don't try to print anything other than the length.

# Solution
```
print(len(input("What is your Name? ")))
```
